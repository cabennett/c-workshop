Purdue-ACM-C-Workshop
=====================

A set of problems with example solutions implemented in C. The focus is predominantly on data structures and algorithm implementations.

The goal of these excercises is to give you a better practical grounding in C programming. Each problem is accompanied by an example solution. These solutions can be used to test your code, as well as help you if you get stuck. However, I would recommend that you attempt to complete each problem before looking at the solution. Simply copying the solution won't help you. You're not doing this for a grade, so you might as well get some value out of it by actually learning C.

The provided solutions may not be perfect. I'm human, as are all of those who have contributed to this project. If you find any bugs, I'd be very greatful if you could make either me or one of the other committers aware so that the issues can be fixed. That way you can contribute to future workshops and help future students.
